  text: "Did you know, over 40 % of kidney failure patients are suffering from
    depression? Patients can remain on dialysis for many years. However, their
    lives will never go back normal again. Over 2 million dialysis patients are
    suffering from old outdated procedures: Patients want to live, not merely
    survive."

      down to just 20 minutes. Patients’ data is logged automatically via
      bluetooth so there’s no more manual repetitive logging, and most
      importantly they can operate it anywhere that’s clean, even in the car.
